# Python Integration

Python is used to automate data entry into Google Sheets.

## Python can write to:
- Registro
- Nominas

## Python must:
- Validate formats before writing
- Never overwrite calculated cells
- Fail loudly if data is invalid

## Input formats
Planned supported formats:
- CSV (manual imports)
- JSON (future AI layer)

Python does not calculate payroll.
It only writes structured data.
