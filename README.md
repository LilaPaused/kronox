Hours tracking and payslip verification for shift workers, using WhatsApp as the interface.

# Kronox

Kronox is a system designed to track worked hours and verify payslips for shift workers.
It is built around a Google Sheets calculation engine, with automation layers added on top.

The goal is simple:
**help workers verify if they are being paid correctly, without using complex apps or spreadsheets.**

## Current status
- Core calculation engine implemented in Google Sheets
- Manual data input fully defined
- Python automation layer planned
- AI input layer planned (future)

## Core principles
- Google Sheets is the source of truth
- Automation never breaks the calculation engine
- AI never writes data without validation
